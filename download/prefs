=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: prefs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Override Blosxom's inline configuration settings on a per-directory, per-flavour, and per-directory-per-flavour basis.

For each generated page, looks for B<pageprefs> and B<pageprefs.flavour> files which should contain valid Perl instructions.

For each story, looks for B<storyprefs> and B<storyprefs.flavour> files which should contain valid Perl instructions.

Prefs has a purpose very similar to Rael Dornfest's B<config> plugin, but was written because in static rendering, B<config> uses the same config file for all pages.

When Blosxom process a page or a story, all prefs files (pageprefs, pageprefs.flavour, storyprefs, storyprefs.flavour) in the directory tree for this page or story are executed. Prefs files for a specific flavour override prefs files applying to all flavours, and prefs files in subdirectories override prefs files in their parents.

pageprefs are executed once per page (when the head of the page is generated), and storyprefs are executed once per story (allowing a per story tuning inside a page).

It is recommanded that you prefix the name of the plugin with a number (for instance, naming it 10prefs) so that it loads before other Blosxom plugins (but after the B<meta> plugin if you use it).

# com.barijaona.blog.source
Barijaona's blog

Currently hosted by github.io through the current config :
- the com.barijaona.blog.source repository reflects a blosxom datadir
- on updates, the blog is statically rendered to the barijaona.github.io repository

Yes, I don't use Jekyll yet… Blosxom static rendering has the same philosophy, was available years before, and I was lazy to change…

## History
This blog was initially hosted on Geocities and produced with Claris Homepage and HTMLTidy.

Later, it moved to Apple's iTools / mac.com / MobileMe and the tools used were Radio Userland, then Blosxom

Later on, it was hosted by dot.mg before being moved to github.io
